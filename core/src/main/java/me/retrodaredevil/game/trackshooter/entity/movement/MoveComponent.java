 * This can have many implementations and is used for being able to call methods that will move an Entity.
 * <p>
 * When update() is called, this should move the entity inside update, it should not use any external input that it
 * did not receive from one of its methods. Ex: Don't take input from a controller directly and have a method that
 * allows you to start going to a target location instead of choosing that target location
 * <p>
 * Note that if x number of update() are called then end() is called, some implementations should be
 * able to be used. (Others that disallow this feature should throw an exception when that happens)
